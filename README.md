## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

The site was running really poorly.
Below 50 on both mobile and desktop when I checked on google speed check.
I followed the instructions that google provided to me.
I was told to minify the css and the javascript.
I did that and asynced the javascript.
This optimized the website tremendously.
Following this, I started to optimize the images.
I noticed the images took a lot of unnecessary memory slowing down runtime significantly.
I change the dimensions of the image to the appropriate scale needed.
After that I lowered the quality of the image enough without distorting the image at all.
With all these steps together. The website is running at a phenomenal 94 mobile and 96 desktop.
In order to now get the pizza site to 60fps or better,  I had to optimize.
I inspected the pizza page and ran a perfomance check to see how poorly it did and what could be optimized. 
I did the same process as before, minified the css and js.
I compressed the images and resized them.
After this, I optimized the needed PizzaSizes function anad update position function. Reducing the number of pizzas that appear on the screen.
